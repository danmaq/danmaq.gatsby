Was it so?</p>\n<h2>Flex SDK note</h2>\n<p>It is a Vector class implemented in Flex SDK 3.2, but unshift seems to be not working. Before and after <code>trace(vec.length);</code> Numerical values ​​do not change even if you try. Even if I search the net all the way I can not find it ... ... or say Flash 10 compatible! Hiding in the shadow of Vector, there are few documents of Vector. Maybe, have you bugged? Would you like to investigate again on a weekend?</p>\n<p>After updating the UIComponent class (the base class of Canvas), the size of Flash swf expanded from 26 KB to 440 KB. A person with a barrage style (Mr. mr.) Said, but I felt the shock since I was boosting the BoE after using Boost in C ++. Are you a demon?</p>\n<h2>1/17 20: 20 Additional notes</h2>\n<p>If you write a very simple code like the one below, Array increases its value normally, but Vector does not increase by more than 1.

However, it seems that it has already been dealt with, but it seems that the latest version of FlexSDK has not healed even if it came in. For the time being, the coding will turn around for the foreseeable future, but would you substitute with splice?</p>',frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"2009-01-16T22:57:00+09:00",strDate:"2009/1/16",title:"Recent report"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/2009/01/16-近況報告-2/",langKey:"en"}}}});
