I do not really understand the circumstances, but they seem to be friends of my parents.</p>\n<p>I played with my brother and Mr. Saito's son, playing Ultraman in a nearby park. Is my son 's age between me and my brother? He was the role of Ultraman, my brother was a monster, I was a mountaineer blown off by a ray.</p>\n<p>And I bought a plastic model on the way home and played a video game for a while. It was not a Nintendo, it was a game machine I've never seen before.</p>\n<p>On the way back, my parents were looking for a hotel saying \"I am sleepy and it is difficult to get home by car, let's stay overnight.\" But, I could not find it in a full room, so I stayed at a hotel.</p>\n<p><strong>I was</strong> told that <strong>\"children should not enter\"</strong> , so I entered secretly so they could not find them. I was scared but inside was a normal room with double bed and vanity.</p>\n<p>And today I hid in the toilet to misappropriate the eyes of the staff once, but I could do the hotel after all without anything in particular.</p>\n<p>Next time I went to my paternal older brother 's house in Tokyo Adachi - ku. So I did a little NES, and after dinner we made Mini 4WD together.</p>",frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"1990-11-04T21:00:00+09:00",strDate:"1990/11/4",title:"diary"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/1990/11/04-diary/",langKey:"en"}}}});
