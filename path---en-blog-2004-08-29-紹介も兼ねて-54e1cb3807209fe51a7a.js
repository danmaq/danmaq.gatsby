Purchased at the bike shop in the neighborhood of my parents house (more than 20 km from my apartment, but w) with an exception of saying 40,000 yen. The master of the motorcycle shop says, "I guess someone has thrown away in the backyard, but since it moved, I will sell it, so I will sell it ..." So ... Is it such a disgrace? But it is a profitable thing itself that you can buy "moving" YB - 1 with only 40,000. When it was originally picked up, it seems that it was quite a rare car specification. There was a trace that was a rare car specification at that time, such as a clear turn indicator, a mirror that is only right, etc., as if it was a wrong handbrake or hand held specially like a handle or something like handles (at the time of purchase it was genuine at the time of purchase). Also, as the Yamaha emblem was gone because it was peeling off, I bought Yamaha\'s tuning fork emblem (gold) and pasted it at Aikio\'s Laicoland. Something has gaps in the adhesive surface ... but I do not mind. <img src="https://danmaq.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/front-300x225.jpg" alt="Full view from YB-1"> I was surprised that the tire was too thin. Are you using a bicycle tire for the first time too? I thought. Although the color of the mirror is different on the right and the left, since there was no mirror on the left at the time of purchase, purchased by skipping the distance of approximately 30 km to Kawagoe\'s drama. I thought about how to keep it right at the right, so I tried to put it on, but it says that the screw hole has become strange to half the depth and it does not enter, or it screws in, it will come out as spot. It must have been screwed the mirror of the positive screw in a forcibly though the rare runner of the absolute predecessor owner was the reverse screw. Well then Napoleonic mirrors with short thread grooves are annihilated. Therefore, it still remains a genuine mirror. A genuine mirror, mirror angle is easy to adjust, but I hate it because the mirror surface breaks easily with a slight vibration of the engine. Also, the head light bulb. Because it was dark enough that I could not think 30W as genuine 30W, I installed a high-intensity halogen light bulb. ... It became better than genuine, that degree. I was immersed in Milk Raleigh and watching the appearance of YB-1 and I was not aware of the slowdown of Raleigh and experienced that it was a collision with another 5 cm. When reflected in that mirrored tank of Raleigh, the tire looks bold due to the curvature of the tank and it looks cool for a moment w</p>',frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"2004-08-29T00:00:02+09:00",strDate:"2004/8/28",title:"Also as an introduction"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/2004/08/29-紹介も兼ねて/",langKey:"en"}}}});
