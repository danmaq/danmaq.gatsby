Everything seemed so small, the scenery in the distance was good.</p>\n<p>When I got off it was a staircase, not an elevator. Although descending, descending a staircase with more than five hundred steps was reasonable.</p>\n<p>I finally played a little at the roof of the tower building where I finally arrived and I took a rest at lunch at the cafeteria on the third floor.</p>\n<p>Next I entered the wax figure museum. I saw various dolls and felt that "wax doll craftmen are amazing".</p>\n<p>Then I went into where I wrote "Mysterious walking path". I was surprised to see myself in the mirror in the place just in. However, I quickly noticed that it was a concave-convex mirror.</p>\n<p>Also, there were lots of things that seemed to be windows, and in that window I saw faucets and baskets of water supply. I seemed to be coming out of the window at the end, so I tried surprisingly because I slipped through my hands.</p>\n<p>"I will return soon"</p>\n<p>My father abruptly said.</p>\n<p>"Are not you going to a special observation platform?"</p>\n<p>I listened but apparently my mother was sick and I abandoned the special observation platform. I thought that I wanted to see more.</p>\n<p>It went raining and it was raining. Because the place where we stopped the car was far away, my coat was getting wet even though I was waiting waiting for an umbrella.</p>',frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"1991-02-10T21:00:00+09:00",strDate:"1991/2/10",title:"diary"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/1991/02/10-diary/",langKey:"en"}}}});
