Modeling tool uses DoGA - L2. Speaking of 3D authoring tools at that time, I knew only the high price Lightwave 3 D and the low price DoGA-L series. This scene is a scene where executive officers and staff are inspecting the satellite "Ark". I will assume the duty of loading only the creatures selected for this satellite and blowing them into space, driving guys who condensed star\'s energy from space into the earth and annihilate the earth. It will be another manga, but it may be close in character to Baan Palace. Although it was originally a gag comic that the feline human quartet evolved, it was transformed into a serious &#x26; stubborn story that drew a war between humans and cats.</p>',frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"1999-08-13T22:00:10+09:00",strDate:"1999/8/13",title:"CATS STORY image CG"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/1999/08/13-cats-story/",langKey:"en"}}}});
