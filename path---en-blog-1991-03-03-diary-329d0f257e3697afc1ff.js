On the way, there was a slide, so we dropped a little way off and tried to capture the maze.</p>\n<p>And we raced with the whole family up to the building on the slope. My brother wears one and I was second.</p>\n<p>I found a go-kart beyond the building, but I got a bit of a beat with a short course.</p>\n<p>I cooked lunch here and killed time with my trampoline until my parents finished eating.</p>\n<p>I played in F1 cart in the afternoon. This is a 3 km course, quite a volume.</p>\n<p>However, I am not good at driving, so I am at the bottom. It was frustrating.</p>\n<p>Finally I headed to the top of the hill with a lift, and I ate sweets there and went home.</p>\n<p>I write this diary while eating the rest of the sweets with a car, but it seems to be good memories today.</p>',frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"1991-03-03T21:00:00+09:00",strDate:"1991/3/3",title:"diary"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/1991/03/03-diary/",langKey:"en"}}}});
