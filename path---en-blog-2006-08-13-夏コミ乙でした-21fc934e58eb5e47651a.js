Since trial version A brought a little bit of 250 and it was over 100, I thought that if I took 500, I thought that it would definitely come out but apparently it seemed to be something called summer comic. Hontto to everyone who did not buy I\'m sorry orz (personally Dattari the pain should not be able to sell you to want to buy gone sold out to make scrimp than spree too much to mass production in desperate) is a sudden, but <a href="/!/thC/">the east Dream drama</a> trial version B1.01 has been released. It is an update patch of trial version A (example great festival version) and trial version B (C70 version). Updates from trial version A2 (web version) are not supported. (If you updated from A to A 2, please roll back to A) Then there is capacity as it is, so please with KIAI. In addition, because the jacket could only be distributed to some people on the day of the summer comic day on the day of printer failure, we prepared a jacket image so that we could print on our own instead of apology. Bundled with trial version B1.01 patch, so please. Why can not I settle down because I want to calm down after summer comics. The limit of winter comic application is severe, it is severe, and there are a lot of things that we have to do with dreams and drama relationships, and we do not want to watch loot items and gifts as quickly as possible and do not want to stack as much as possible.
