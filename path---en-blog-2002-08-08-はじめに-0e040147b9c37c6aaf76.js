For the time being, as a reminiscence memorial, I tried such a corner of column mates instead of a diary. Naming it, "A <strong>good story about this site</strong> ." As its name suggests, <em>I treat only truly anything, I do not know what kind of story it will deviate from now</em> . Trivia I thought suddenly and the story behind this site is something that I do not care but it seems like I was going to explain it for the first time or if I think I had talked about Prairiegg last week, this week I was suddenly talking about programming with Direct3D And etc. (For reference, the author has never seen live prairie dogs.) I think that this column will be updated around the weekend as a guide, but if there is something I want to write something in real time I will write. Well, let \'s introduce this neighborhood and let\' s get into a good story soon. Although I changed my name about three times in the past, this is the fourth time I made a major renewal to change the name of the site. So I tried hooking on "Force" and "4th". As you may already know, I designed only to forcibly attach <em>F</em> and <em>Y</em> of this logo, "_ F<em>orce. _Y</em> ". Hahahahahaha.</p>\n<h2>update information</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Proprietary domain acquisition &#x26; renewal.</li>\n<li>Add 1 software to Software Force.</li>\n</ul>',frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"2002-08-08T00:00:00+09:00",strDate:"2002/8/7",title:"Introduction"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/2002/08/08-はじめに/",langKey:"en"}}}});
