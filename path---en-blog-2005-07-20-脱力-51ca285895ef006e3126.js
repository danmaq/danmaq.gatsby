There are many things to do. I wonder if I need a reasonable rest if I pass through the human scene. It is feeling that gradual motivation has come back somewhat after finishing nearly a week. Since the bulletin board currently being used is the end of service at the end of next month, I tried setting up a <a href="https://twitter.com/danmaq">new bulletin board</a> . I would be pleased if you could use it if there was something. I restricted it and tried various expansion of the <a href="/tag/head">manager introduction</a> page. For the moment the introduction of PC which I have been engaged in creation until now is main, but I would like to do various other things such as introduction of DTM equipment I have used so far. But if you have such leisure next ... something ... Gehungung Hoon, eh?
