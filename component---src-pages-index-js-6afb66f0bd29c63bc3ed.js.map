If `g` is as above and `_` is [`R.__`](#__),\n\t * the following are equivalent:\n\t *\n\t *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n\t *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n\t *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n\t *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n\t *\n\t * @func\n\t * @memberOf R\n\t * @since v0.5.0\n\t * @category Function\n\t * @sig Number -> (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n\t * @param {Number} length The arity for the returned function.\n\t * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n\t * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n\t * @see R.curry\n\t * @example\n\t *\n\t *      var sumArgs = (...args) => R.sum(args);\n\t *\n\t *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curryN(4, sumArgs);\n\t *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n\t *      var g = f(3);\n\t *      g(4); //=> 10\n\t */\n\tmodule.exports = _curry2(function curryN(length, fn) {\n\t  if (length === 1) {\n\t    return _curry1(fn);\n\t  }\n\t  return _arity(length, _curryN(length, [], fn));\n\t});\n\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 15 */,\n/* 16 */,\n/* 17 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = function _has(prop, obj) {\n\t  return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, prop);\n\t};\n\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 18 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\tvar _curry2 = __webpack_require__(1);\n\tvar _dispatchable = __webpack_require__(7);\n\tvar _map = __webpack_require__(86);\n\tvar _reduce = __webpack_require__(21);\n\tvar _xmap = __webpack_require__(449);\n\tvar curryN = __webpack_require__(14);\n\tvar keys = __webpack_require__(27);\n\t\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * Takes a function and\n\t * a [functor](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land#functor),\n\t * applies the function to each of the functor's values, and returns\n\t * a functor of the same shape.\n\t *\n\t * Ramda provides suitable `map` implementations for `Array` and `Object`,\n\t * so this function may be applied to `[1, 2, 3]` or `{x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}`.\n\t *\n\t * Dispatches to the `map` method of the second argument, if present.\n\t *\n\t * Acts as a transducer if a transformer is given in list position.\n\t *\n\t * Also treats functions as functors and will compose them together.\n\t *\n\t * @func\n\t * @memberOf R\n\t * @since v0.1.0\n\t * @category List\n\t * @sig Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b\n\t * @param {Function} fn The function to be called on every element of the input `list`.\n\t * @param {Array} list The list to be iterated over.\n\t * @return {Array} The new list.\n\t * @see R.transduce, R.addIndex\n\t * @example\n\t *\n\t *      var double = x => x * 2;\n\t *\n\t *      R.map(double, [1, 2, 3]); //=> [2, 4, 6]\n\t *\n\t *      R.map(double, {x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}); //=> {x: 2, y: 4, z: 6}\n\t * @symb R.map(f, [a, b]) = [f(a), f(b)]\n\t * @symb R.map(f, { x: a, y: b }) = { x: f(a), y: f(b) }\n\t * @symb R.map(f, functor_o) = functor_o.map(f)\n\t */\n\tmodule.exports = _curry2(_dispatchable(['fantasy-land/map', 'map'], _xmap, function map(fn, functor) {\n\t  switch (Object.prototype.toString.call(functor)) {\n\t    case '[object Function]':\n\t      return curryN(functor.length, function() {\n\t        return fn.call(this, functor.apply(this, arguments));\n\t      });\n\t    case '[object Object]':\n\t      return _reduce(function(acc, key) {\n\t        acc[key] = fn(functor[key]);\n\t        return acc;\n\t      }, {}, keys(functor));\n\t    default:\n\t      return _map(fn, functor);\n\t  }\n\t}));\n\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 19 */,\n/* 20 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\tvar _curry2 = __webpack_require__(1);\n\tvar _equals = __webpack_require__(424);\n\t\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * Returns `true` if its arguments are equivalent, `false` otherwise.
