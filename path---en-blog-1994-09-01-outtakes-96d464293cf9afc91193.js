The story is almost equal to none and the system is completely Elfalia\'s pakuri. In addition, I did not know task logic etc at that time, so I could not make any game of this type.</p>\n<h2>(1992-1996) CAT\'S STORY (former name: "Abominable cat troupe")</h2>\n<p>Original RPG.</p>\n<p>Although I was thinking quite well with a story or something, I\'m exhausted due to technical reasons (above). It was about 2003 when I gained the skills to create this game. Reading the source code written by Mr. Yaneune led to decisive skill improvement.</p>\n<p>By the way CATS STORY is the original story I thought about when I was 10 years old. At that time, I often draw comics, but starting with doing all the principal characters to cats just as "just messed up" was not understood how to write story comics in only 4 frames. Scenario changed dramatically by about 3 times so far. (A story in the Arabian parallel world first, then a fantasy-like RPG ordinary system, then a slightly dark story.)</p>\n<h2>(1996-1999) BATTLEST (formerly known as CATS STORY Fighting Edition)</h2>\n<p>I do not know if the influence of KOF 95/96 &#x26; SF ZERO 2 I was addicted to at that time, but I wanted to try making a giant impulsively. Although it set up only a concept, it was technically difficult to abandon it. Afterwards it was restored by being taken to by a friend, but after all it was technically somewhat dull.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, with the help of <a href="http://www.vector.co.jp/soft/win95/game/se045045.html">Knuckle Fighter-X</a> , something like a prototype was finished. I wonder if it is around MUGEN now.</p>\n<h2>(1999) 2K ppm</h2>\n<p>Pop\'n music trainer. Planning started by being mailed to someone. Eventually it will be integrated as a plugin for " <a href="/2993">Bring your own Music &#x26; Sounds [BMS]</a> " and the project ends before development starts.</p>\n<h2>(1999) beatstage (formerly known as PS2K)</h2>\n<p>BMS player on the pop-stage stage. I have hardly played at the moment and it is undecided whether to start production. Even if I do, I should try to make it a plugin format for " <a href="/2993">Bring your own Music &#x26; Sounds [BMS]</a> ".</p>\n<h2>(2000) SINGFREAKS</h2>\n<p>A game software that looks exactly like Dream Audition. I am tired at the planning stage because there are too many technical investigation items.</p>\n<h2>(1997-1999) JIJIHAZARD ~ ジ ジ ハ ザ ー ド</h2>\n<p>3D action game devised by <a href="http://mixi.jp/show_friend.pl?id=2308126">Mr. Butter Bean</a> . The game system is uncanny. It was Ton Demo setting that the G virus spreads and all the students in the school become Gizza.</p>\n<p>Because it was thrown entirely from planning, specifications to implementation, only summarizing rough planning / scenario, we could not secure more production time than it was.</p>\n<h2>(2005) TOUHOU UNREALTOURNAMENT -beat the oriental phantasm! -</h2>\n<p><img src="https://danmaq.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Logo.png"> It is a secondary creation STG in the east. However, if you associate something similar to the original home you may be beginning to feel a bit stuck. As far as the range of the genre called STG is compared to Gensokyo, it will be different from the hometown of purple with Hakurei Shrine.</p>\n<p>I am tired with a lot of technical verification items. (At the time it was full of just displaying 3D still model,) If I knew the existence of XNA or Unity 3D from this time, perhaps there was a one-chan.</p>',frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"1994-09-01T00:00:00+09:00",strDate:"1994/8/31",title:"Works that collapsed without production"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/1994/09/01-outtakes/",langKey:"en"}}}});
