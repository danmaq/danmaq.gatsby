"Master, amusement park Iko?" "Well?" "Because the master has always withdrawn, sometimes I have to go out!</p>\n<p>Well, that\'s it. I think that it is too abrupt. Walking in the garden with Miku, the first choice was a roller coaster. I\'m skipping miku from the beginning ...... What is it like traveling vocaloid? "Oh, oh my, because I\'m a miku, because my ears may be broken if I talk about caching, will you be able to open next to me?> &#x3C;> It\'s a casual excuse ... everyone else\'s guide It looks like a strange face. But I said something and emptied Miku \'s side, so I slipped into it. Certainly Miku\'s cake is certainly noticeable, but it is not enough to break my ears. Do not you notice me because it is Sister\'s guide? I do not care how I am air.</p>\n<p>What got you next was a haunted house. Miku is running like a regular girl and crawling around.

Actually I did various attractions besides the haunted house and the roller coaster, but omitting because it is too long to write here. The train on the way back was crowded, so I was on the street. As I walked around the garden a lot, my legs seemed to be sticks, but I guess that it costs around 1 person for transportation, so I will endure this much. By the way it is rumored that this apartment, ghosts are going out, everyone has retreated, only we are entering now, Miku is not got it? Because I say that I trust Miku and stay here. I do not have room for moving.</p>\n<p>"Today is an instant, but I\'m sorry," Miku sowed sugar rice from the range conveniently in the bowl.

"To be sure ... how much is Miku vocaloid so much, so if you die, you will not be a ghost?"
