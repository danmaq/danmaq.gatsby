In the last time I said that overall the tempo is fast, but in fact, it seems that the songs that were selected were only accidentally fast. AFRICA is pretty slow. Besides, the arrow fell to 60 fps, so I felt it more quickly than the actual tempo. After, maniac. How to put out maniac (basically all tricks) start while pressing the right and left selection buttons. Just like Versus. Moreover, the arrow changes. Normally it is somewhat simple feeling, but the trick (old ANOTHER) seemed to be sloppy, something, maniac was feeling something somewhat. The degree of difficulty is not so bad. The distance between the arrows got wider, making it hard to pick up a store. Also, human beings disappear. that's all.</p>",frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"1999-07-31T15:52:00+09:00",strDate:"1999/7/31",title:"One person sadly repo in a room where there is no one.
