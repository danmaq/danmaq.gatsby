Furiously nowadays, I upgraded my main PC to Windows Vista. Once as a software developer I\'m sorry I thought that it would not be possible to confirm the operation check with Vista. <a href="palx190dr">Since my notebook</a> is not a basic Vista-compatible model, it seems that the score of the Windows Experience Index was 1.0 across the board or the preinstalled application was annihilated at first in the installation, but the driver of TecraM 4 was dropped in, or <a href="http://laptopvideo2go.com/">laptopvideo 2go.com</a> While I tried and tried various things like pinching in the driver, it seemed like Vista machine to some extent. The lowest score was also raised to 2.4. I still can not use hibernation and standby (falling back &#x26; not returning), but I will use it except when driving the battery, it will go to the battery itself and it will not be usable anymore, so I should say otherwise. So, I thought using it lightly. Surely it is more rugged than XP, but it is irresistibly stable. (Especially in IE.XP it will freeze with just a few pages open.) Then I was surprised that WindowsAero moves crisper than I imagined. Sometimes suddenly Aero runs out and may not return until it restarts, but since the total VRAM capacity is lower than the system requirements in the first place, there is no point in there. It is a confirmation of the operation of my own self-made software in the past. As far as we keep up below, XP will work but it will not work on Vista! It does not seem to be like that.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To put it in the Program Files folder, run it with administrator privileges.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you do not want to run the administrator, avoid placing it in the Program Files folder and Windows folder.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If it does not move by any means, set compatibility information in the property of exe. However, it has not been tested seriously for convenience of time, so some software may not really work. I have not tested any sounds of Gessimu series that I made. However, I think that I was really glad that I really bought Vista. Because the game I was building right now was using a trick that does not move unless it is administrator authority in Vista.</p>\n<h2>I made a community site</h2>\n<p>Planned and produced the <a href="http://prodigy-inc.co.jp/">syllabary</a> <a href="http://prodigy-inc.co.jp/labo/socrates/">community site "Socrates dies"</a> (operated: <a href="http://prodigy-inc.co.jp/">PRODIGY Co., Ltd.)</a> . It is still a pre-alpha test version, please use it.</p>\n<h2>I participated in the summer comic</h2>\n<p>Since it was only published this time, I did not notice in particular, but I joined the circle at the summer comic. (East M - 45 b) Thank you very much for everyone who came in, those who just came to talk to me east (truly).</p>\n<h2>moving</h2>\n<p><img src="https://danmaq.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/HI380463-300x225.jpg" alt="Click to enlarge."> Safely, I finished moving. It took me a month and a half if I thought comfortably that arrangement of luggage at the beginning of the move would be over in a week or so. I have lots of luggage. It is quite small because the area of ​​the room has become two thirds of the previous one. Moreover, since the entrance and the toilet are unnecessarily wide, it is a long and narrow structure, so I feel about half real. Saitama who lived until the early summer of 2007 is about the same area as the apartment in Arashiyama, but it still feels like 2/3. However, as expected, there is only a high-rise floor with the best spectacular views, with cemetery spreading under the eyes. It\'s weeping. I thought that the best thing would be to go to work by bicycle 30 minutes away from there. It is okay if you abandoned the last train. ...... Even though there are transfers on the way how much I wonder how commuting time is almost unchanged by bicycle and train What\'s this?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>',frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"2009-08-30T00:00:00+09:00",strDate:"2009/8/29",title:"Survival report"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/2009/08/30-生存報告-2/",langKey:"en"}}}});
