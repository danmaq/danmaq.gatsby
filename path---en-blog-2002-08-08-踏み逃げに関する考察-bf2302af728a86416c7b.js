Originally the access counter exists for the purpose of counting the number of accesses up to the present. Perhaps it seems that there are only a few people who think that it is a pleasure to take a good chestnut count. And there are busy people who rush around Web sites called Web sites and search for materials. Even if such a person came by chance from the search site and accidentally took 10,000 counts or the like, I do not think I will report it first. Also, it is a fact that contents are shabo with high probability only for the site which says somehow stepping on escape ban is prohibited. Perhaps the site is too boring and administrators took the hardships. As the worst case, I also heard that when I took a Kiri number and report it, I was sent a bad drawing (and also an uncompressed BMP file) with attached mail. Personally I think that it does not matter if communication is established with the report itself of the killi number itself, but I think that "compulsion" is not good. In other words, I believe that <em>"prohibition of escape from stepping" and "prohibition of passing through" are contrary to extreme netiquette</em> .</p>',frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"2002-08-08T05:58:23+09:00",strDate:"2002/8/7",title:"Consideration on stepping escape"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/2002/08/08-踏み逃げに関する考察/",langKey:"en"}}}});
