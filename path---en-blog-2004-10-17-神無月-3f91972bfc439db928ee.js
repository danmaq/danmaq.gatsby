During work, when the trader is driving the pile foundation, it breaks down the underground high voltage line and causes power failure until the next building night. Thanks to 390 yen (tax included) I lost Chinese noodles. If you are driving from the inside of the premises as it is already looking out from the premises, it will be a big fuss because the electricity shop says that all the power of Omiya has been stopped, including Marui, Daiei, and Sonic City to JACK. Well, is it unfortunate that the electric shock was done only in the next building but also the electric shooter did not come out? Speaking of disasters, there are many earthquakes. It may be the time of the Great Kanto Earthquake. Well now forecasted. The next big earthquake will happen on <em>September 1</em> , <em>1923</em> . no doubt!</p>",frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"2004-10-17T00:00:00+09:00",strDate:"2004/10/16",title:"Kannazuki"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/2004/10/17-神無月/",langKey:"en"}}}});
