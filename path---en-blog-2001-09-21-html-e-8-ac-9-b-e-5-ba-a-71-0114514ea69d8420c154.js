Normally surrounded by <code>&#x3C;～></code> is called "tag", but only <code>!DOCTYPE</code> is called "declaration". This is an important thing to declare the following version of <code>&#x3C;html></code> ~ <code>&#x3C;/html></code> . For the time being, HTML version is relatively easy to use 3.2. Frequently, this declaration is often missing at the beginning of the book, but this is a big mistake.</p>\n<p>Next <code>&#x3C;html></code> . I hope that the part enclosed in <code>&#x3C;html></code> ~ <code>&#x3C;/html></code> is the contents of HTML.</p>\n<p><code>&#x3C;body></code> . The part surrounded by this is regarded as a visible part such as a document or image. It will be appreciated if you look up here, but basically the tag is <code>&#x3C;～></code> starts with <code>&#x3C;/～></code> ending in.</p>\n<p><code>&#x3C;p></code> indicates that the part surrounded by this is a paragraph. If you write a document as you wish in it, it will be completed as a homepage for the time being.</p>',frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"2001-09-21T15:19:00+09:00",strDate:"2001/9/21",title:"HTML Course 1"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/2001/09/21-html%e8%ac%9b%e5%ba%a71/",langKey:"en"}}}});
