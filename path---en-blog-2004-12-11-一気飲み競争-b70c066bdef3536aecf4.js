I am already famous for the 3rd one already, so it seems that there are also many people who know that, Spiritus is the world\'s strongest alcohol with a vodka friend and an alcohol degree of 96 degrees. Bukkake, almost alcohol. Alcohol is too strong, "fire is prohibited" comes first before "sake from 20 years old" comes first. It is comparatively easy to obtain (If it is a liquor store dealing imported vodka, it is mostly located in the shop front), so if you issue 2000 yen, you can buy it, so why buy things like that? By the way, just by smelling the smell, somehow memories of the vaccination at the time of elementary school revive in the brain. You can also see a monster phenomenon called ice sinking when poured into a glass. A good boy should not drink even a bottle. Far away from a bottle, if you can drink a half of a glass it is already God certified. Reimu is just abnormal.</p>',frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"2004-12-11T00:57:00+09:00",strDate:"2004/12/10",title:"Chugoku drinking competition"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/2004/12/11-一気飲み競争/",langKey:"en"}}}});
