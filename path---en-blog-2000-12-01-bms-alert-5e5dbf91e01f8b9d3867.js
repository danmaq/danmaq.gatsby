This is the first work I have handled for Minimal Techno. Because the origin of the title was told to acquaintance and it was laughed that "it sounded like the sound of a train shutdown machine".

It is just human reversal.</p>\n<h2>Additional September 7, 2009</h2>\n<p>The BMS version added the NORMAL music score, and the difficulty level setting of the conventional music score was restored from seventh to twelve.
