Just watching the clock 2: 30, it is terribly creepy. I do not know if it is dawn, but in the middle of the night, it is unlikely that they are going to cry so long. Whether it is a thing of a thing or a bug of a precursor of a catastrophe ... The fear that once flew away hardly flees, as if to protect herself, she hid in a futon. If it is attacked by a thing of a thing, it knows that it will not stand any role such as a futon (excluding sexual meaning). When I look at the clock again, although the ticking sound is ringing, the second hand not turning with only a slight swing ..... as if it is being cursed at 02:30. ...... Suddenly the third fear, the second threat to the mind, flew out of the bed and ran away from the loft, and opened the window with a tremendous momentum ... .... a cloudy sky that shines purely. In retrospect the digital watch under the loft was about to go around 8:25.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hint: holiday (holiday work day)</li>\n<li>Further hint: I do not want to write</li>\n</ul>",frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"2006-06-17T08:38:00+09:00",strDate:"2006/6/16",title:"Curse of 02:30, crow of the night"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/2006/06/17-0230の呪い、夜中のカラス/",langKey:"en"}}}});
