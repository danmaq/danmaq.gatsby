Although the start dash was so soon, it was quickly pulled out and, when I got to the finish, it was the sixth place of resumption. I worked hard and I was glad that I got the result of myself.</p>\n<p>The next event, skill passing "It is increasingly powerful". Although it was a team warfare, as a result of trying not to pull the legs of the blue team to which I belong, only the lowest rank was escaped.</p>\n<p>Next time I played the last game I participated in the morning, a cheering battle. We cheered with a shouting voice.</p>\n<p>I have not served the next competition.
