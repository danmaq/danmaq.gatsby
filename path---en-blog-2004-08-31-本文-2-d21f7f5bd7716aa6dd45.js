Oh, what do you mean? Reimu, am I too loud? I am sorry, damn it! This time I will listen to what I say! At first I thought it would be fine if you got angry and it would be a barrage match, did not you think secretly that your preface to secretly break my mini-Hakka kiln? This broom! book of magic! All this house is mine! Why can you easily break this guy! What? Well, Reimu, look at your rival! (No!) I'm telling you to look straight ahead! ! I guess that is not even the opponent of barrage matches any longer? Takapie! (Why are you doing this!) Shut up! Fucking! ! (You are drunk! Do you think that I can do such things !?) Separately I will not do anything! Now, go to Drive! (No!) Sit down in front! (I will not be able to leave the shrine! What if you settled in a youkai?)

You should have noticed when your attitude cried out ... We ... Where are you going, come back! From me, I can not run away! Reimu, here are only two people! There is no one elsewhere!
