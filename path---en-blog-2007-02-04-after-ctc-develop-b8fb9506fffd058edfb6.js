I think the delivery was 2/4 orz early today, even if it is late, it is from tomorrow.</p>\n<h2>Recent situation</h2>\n<p>I'm a good guy. As it is this way it will be straight to the thirty ksg ksg That's why it's the first time in a month. If you notice it is already 1 month old older brother! (What are you talking about) I'd like to update frequently soon, but it seems that time does not allow much time. It is also up to you to update until the creation time is over, and I am sorry to update it once every half a month. Because a little time is pressing, ← 's picture is pardon orz</p>\n<h2>... Up to this point, the guy who wrote on the weekend after the opening of the New Year</h2>\n<p>I feel fine. I was pretty tired of making a final dream of a middle-end dream that I can not return at work, but when I take a year off and take paid for a week and seeing the reaction to the surrounding dreams, I feel enormous. For the time being, it is a daily routine to nip out certain boards and certain boards. I would appreciate it if you could imagine an image just like Hyodo Kazunoda. The reaction to my place there is the best of vitality and vitality. Well, I thought I'm sorry I was sorry, but I'm sorry ^ ^ ^ I've been feeling toro recently 'A `... ... because I did not say at all! That guy was disrespectfully disgusted, I got one Odysan.</p>\n<p>Well before it cheers me up. For a while, the new work will take a rest and I will give you a remake version of my work (Tokijo Castle / Dream End). As for the dream drama, is it like an expansion pack rather than a remake version? Tokijo Castle is scheduled for patch and press CD edition, dream drama only (at least for the moment) patch version. And when these two have been done, we will be making a new work. It will be STG in the east again. I'm sorry for those who expected different. Originally it is a game unrelated to the barrage at the time of bearing danmaq's circle name ry (What is Leila) What is it that I thought I was losing if I worked It was that I got a job and probably C72 I think that it will be in time by / 73. And the title will be again, \"Oriental ○ ○ ○\". But this time it is a part of ○, do not do it, make it a slightly twisted name. It is not even three more letters (I wrote ○○○ for convenience). The person who applied total characters wants to be headed within 100 years.</p>\n<p>So whatever short one is a year and a half, three years if you do it normally, and five years if you do it at ease. As a danmaq, I will create a second in the East. I would be pleased if you would expect it.</p>\n<p>That's a serious new year offset (now a month) than the last update. I got a super late Papa Fever, but it seems to me that the character only looks at that certain D - sub 9 pin. Thank you so much.</p>\n<h2>Oops, I forgot</h2>\n<p>We released <a href=\"/!/thC/\">Toho Yume Drama <em>Complete version R1.02</em> patch</a> . The inconvenience that the spelling comment display is wrong, and the inconvenience that the data become wrong when replayed playing have been corrected here and there mainly. Unfortunately, Replay compatibility with R1.01 is only 1 to 4 stages and all spelling practices (I tried hard for 2 weeks and a half in order to secure replay compatibility but it is already Muri Poz). The patch target is the complete version R1.00 to R1.01. Also, please be aware that first-aid measures such as bulletin boards may fail to patch if it is not rolled back once.</p>\n<h2>I further forgot</h2>\n<p>Although it is <a href=\"http://e.danmaq.com/\">web mail ordering</a> of <a href=\"http://e.danmaq.com/\">danmaq works including dream drama</a> which I had been doing since last month, it has been in <em>full swing</em> . However, some commissions have been revised compared to the pilot operation. First, cash on delivery fee has changed from 250 yen to 350 yen. Instead, from 4 or more, the shipping fee will be 3 to 300 yen from 240 yen to 390 yen. The point above, thank you for your understanding.</p>\n<h2>Well then</h2>\n<p>That is why it is not applaudable. (Personal memorandum: You should also release trial version C2.02)</p>\n<h2>(Beat) Dream Theater Fun Fun Yume Dreams www, I am not thinking of overwhelming pressure of spelling (゜ Д ゜) Pocahn</h2>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) ~ It seems to be an incentive to buy from current pen 4 to core 2duo. I think that intel should thank Mc.</h2>\n<p>Rather than saying that you should thank the author of barrage style if it is motivated to say so</p>\n<h2>(Beat) We enjoyed somewhere except dreams, the standing pictures, the roads, the songs and the scenario</h2>\n<p>Thank you for your answer as expected.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) It is a silence to the former representative, so it is decided to do. ~</h2>\n<p>No, no, if someone in the circle gets chugged, I guess what I'm thinking, but it seems that if it is a general participation that kind of relationship does not mean that there are not a few who keep wigaya. In fact there was something that the captains who are capi - casping with silent prison ignorance at the event not related at all were in front of our house. Cho BAD ~! Well that's why I want to say 'A `(I was surprised to see that this was not a dead word at this time, though)</p>\n<h2>(Beat) ~ In this environment the score clearing at EX clearing has become EASY ~</h2>\n<p>I will fix it with www wwwww vR1.02. (Post note: I did)</p>\n<h2>(Beat) txt Imif</h2>\n<p>It might not be a text that you can understand though it is not even solving that stage and that stage. Nested txt</p>\n<p>maq</p>\n<h2>(Beat) at the eastern side ○ ○ ○, the barrage STG, additionally it is not the attitude that traced the appearance and the system side and made the head house foolish. ~</h2>\n<p>But the next work (Tokijo Castle v2 / after the dream drama v2) is also the barrage STG that touched the name of the east. However, it is finally finished with a dream drama and it seems to get out of the barrage style. Well I also have plans to return to the barrage style.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) I think that it is better to die because it does not say bad things.</h2>\n<p>It is impossible to the extent that it does not die, such as being aimed at by some group or being stung by a wanderer. Natural death or extraordinary exaggeration. You know what I say often, \"I live only for those who are just me\".</p>\n<h2>(Beat) I came from a multiple breastplate</h2>\n<p>Please walk as it is and go home</p>\n<h2>(Beat) 0.6 M</h2>\n<p>Oh, what is 600 mm? I thought but maybe you are talking about the dream drama vR 1.01 patch? I need the full version CD of vR 1.00 to install. By the way, the complete version has a capacity of roughly 450 MB.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) The reason why handling of characters is frustrating is ~</h2>\n<p>It is okay to say that it is roughly such a feeling, although it is not so much as to say that reason alone.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) Is not it related to confusion and number?</h2>\n<p>I am sorry I was misunderstood something. For the time being, Touhou ○ ○ ○ is next time, but probably it will be a twisted name that will not be done in the main house. I wrote OOO for convenience in omake, but it is not even three letters.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) extra txt is pretty bad. I'm making this kind of squirrel</h2>\n<p>That two lines are absolutely incomprehensible unless you read all the conversations between ED and that stage. Because it contains absolutely impossible keywords in the east, ww (Well, it's completely impossible ...... because there are villages)</p>\n<h2>(Beat) EX appearance condition is unknown and it feels stiff (t Д `)</h2>\n<p>Tomorrow chooses a different aircraft for the time being.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) ~ If I have enough ability to freeze Gensokyo 's water in Cirno, I think that it is a capability suitable for Rasubosu.</h2>\n<p>Even if Cirno himself is not able to reach that capability, it is possible if there is a dirty thought in Cirno's brain that is not as pure as anything. Anyway it is a Gensokyo and it is not only Cirno who has enough ability to manipulate the cold.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) I can not think of an example of \"a person capable of trembling Gensokyo who became a small fish boss of the first half stage\" ~</h2>\n<p>Should I answer the purple root of the imaginary thought? Basically at the main house, the first half route is exceptionally excluding Cirno, so it's all original, so there is no way I can illustrate it. (When saying or if it reappears, most of it will be on your own machine.) Another reason for \"Another treatment of rasubos and EX boss as zako\" is a little rasp boss conversation including hints. (It will be spoiled so I will refrain it here)</p>\n<h2>(Beat) Because of its ability you can become the root of all evil and become rasubos and EX boss.</h2>\n<p>Of course there is no competence, for example a human being in a village can not be a rasubos. In exceptional cases Alice makes puppet and so on, but I guess it is impossible for me to become a boss, but in principle the basic fighting power to a certain extent to the principal, apparently enough to be able to appear as a minimum boss first, that is, Ability to fly and declare a spell card · Ability to use it is necessary. (By the way, I recognize that small devils and big fairies, Lily can use spells.I just did not feel like using spells in this volume.) If you do not keep the scope of definition to battle power only, If it is said that it is a generic name that includes inclusion, in that case will be exactly as you say.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) Thank you for making Toho Dreams Drama, it's so funny!</h2>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) = Oriental football raids</h2>\n<p>I'm sorry - I am interested but I failed to get it ('· ω · `)</p>\n<h2>(Beat) I think that it was better not to make it in such a way</h2>\n<p>There is a wonderful keyword in the world saying \"One who did better than tied up is won\". I think that Mr. 47 (in many ways) is a winning group. I want him to go to the place where he goes without compromising here.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) I came from a multiple breastplate. Only danmaq is the last hope of the eastern neighborhood. Good luck.</h2>\n<p>Salary</p>\n<h2>(Beat) I came from a multiple breastplate and do not persevere.</h2>\n<p>Discipline</p>\n<h2>(Beat) scenario D Introduction of stage 3 is Queen Miki's pakuri. The intro of stage 6 is Pakuri of Noah's ark. Scenario A Marisa's line of Stage 3 is Death Note's Pakuri. Scenario D Marisa's line of Stage 2 is Pikmin 's pakuri. Marisa's line of Stage 4 is Laputa's pakuri. Can you only play, can not you?</h2>\n<p>TOO CHO!</p>\n<h2>(Beat) What is this feces gay. I will not buy it anymore.</h2>\n<p>That is the best choice. Although the priest also said someday, I think that what a way to squeeze a million people in a doujin game is perfectly secondary to self-satisfaction. Well, if this is a game of 10,000 uk uke, if the number of items that can be sold is one digit wwww</p>\n<h2>(Beat) I cried with ED. Thank you for a dream drama</h2>\n<p>Regarding the story, it is exactly half-hearted, is not it? It's a pretty drunk scenario.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) The story of the dream drama, does Makara himself feel good or bad What kind of impression do you have?</h2>\n<p>I think that I will not publish at least what I thought was bad on my own.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) ~ The decelerating bullet does not suit her.</h2>\n<p>That is the real pleasure of secondary creation. Udonge is also a tsundere, a person who made blue cat Robo once was stupid.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) How can you do something about loading once per retry at SPA</h2>\n<p>With the specification of the barrage style, <em>it is also possible if the replay preservation function is completely crushed</em> . By the way, there was not even a retry at Seijo at the previous work.</p>\n<p>(I went back to the barrack style menu every time I played once)</p>\n<h2>(Beat) Dream star play PLAY I let you ^ ^ Thank you for the impression ...</h2>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) Do not feed the awakening, do not patch early!</h2>\n<p>I am honest.</p>",frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"2007-02-04T00:00:00+09:00",strDate:"2007/2/3",title:"When the first spring comes to the present world, the spring of illusion somewhere sorrowful"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/2007/02/04-after-ctc-develop/",langKey:"en"}}}});
