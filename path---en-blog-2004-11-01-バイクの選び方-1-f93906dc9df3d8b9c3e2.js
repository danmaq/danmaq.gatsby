I think that it is hands to get the 2st guy out of now as it is, how about you? By the way, fuel economy is supposed to run 50 km roundtrip of 25 km with mopeds, 1.5 liters for 2 st, and about 0.5 liter for 4 st. (It's pretty texty, but I have to do a weird strange thing like that.) The price is weak at 1L130 yen even at high octane. When thinking of this, the train can only be thought of as Botta. The next choice is whether to be a scooter or a mission type. Since the scooter gets used to it soon, it's fun but it gets bored. The mission takes quite a while to get used, but if you get used to it you can enjoy a tokoton until it gets broken. It is also advantageous that the mission is easier to tinker than the scooter. If you buy at the end you are second hand. Originality is baky because it is brand new. Just avoid net auctions because they are credible.</li>\n</ul>",frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"2004-11-01T00:00:00+09:00",strDate:"2004/10/31",title:"How to choose a motorcycle 1"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/2004/11/01-バイクの選び方-1/",langKey:"en"}}}});
