I think that the activity shrinking period will continue for a while, but thank you in the future. Since the counter was reset once at the same time as the circle was started up, if it included even before that, it is about +250 thousand more.

Since I do not have the energy to make all machine language to bullets and other objects, convert it to native for the time being only the statement part of while or loop. (Even though it does native compilation, it does not mean that you can do a single exe, it will work from a base application like barrage style as usual.) Even just this, it seems that processing speed differs much more than interpreter and intermediate language Is it only for us to do? However, lastly I wrote the assembler crisply more than 10 years ago (and moreover, it was 80286), now I can hardly remember it, the current machine language is complicated and it seems that it will be able to follow very well on my uncle's head Far from being not worse, if you do not do it well, the current VC ++ compiler is too good and the interpreter will be faster. It is just a matter of thinking (or nothing more than just ⑨), and with that kind of feeling for now it is in a state of stepping on a second stroke. Just for good it <a href=\"http://dmf.shrinemaiden.org/OpenDMF\">seems</a> that the next generation barrage style of <a href=\"http://dmf.shrinemaiden.org/OpenDMF\">OpenDMF</a> is being made, and while I wktk over there, I feel that it would be better if I made thG (tentative name). In the first place, if you think carefully, it seems like that optimization is going to be done, and if it is mr. mr. surely (o ...... now, it was thG (provisional name) now. <a href=\"http://thg.danmaq.com/\">Still secretly</a> because it is <a href=\"http://thg.danmaq.com/\">still</a> \"pre - test version (previous version before trial version)\".</p>",frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"2008-04-21T21:43:00+09:00",strDate:"2008/4/21",title:"100 million visits"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/2008/04/21-深謝百萬来場/",langKey:"en"}}}});
