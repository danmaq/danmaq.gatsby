"Would you like to see Omiya Park a while ago today?" No, I am working today, I reply that I will not be able to recover from a cold so much so I reply that I will not do it at a later date, "I just want to talk a bit, so today is impossible?" I do not like that a bit somewhat disoriently orz It reminds me of being a bit overwhelmed by being so familiar with not being able to meet it like that for a while but it seems that I finally broke up in 3 round trips of reply and then it seems like "Omiya on the weekend Let\'s meet at the park station. " Even so, I remember a strange strange somewhere. Especially "Meeting place is Omiya Park station". Surely the first time I saw him the nearest was supposed to be somewhere. Personally I do not feel like something unlikely, but how about as everyone looking at this diary? Is it a bit too much for me?</p>',frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"2007-02-26T10:18:00+09:00",strDate:"2007/2/26",title:"Mysterious teaser"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/2007/02/26-謎のお誘い/",langKey:"en"}}}});
