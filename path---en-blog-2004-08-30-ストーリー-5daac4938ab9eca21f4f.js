The day keeps us feeling midsummer even before the rainy season has already entered. It was a very ordinary everyday, but Reimu was extremely bored. Actually, in the past few days, Marisa which is a killer of rushing time does not come to the shrine. Even though I usually came like every day ... boring days, as well as days of disturbance. The sun went down today, but Marisa did not come. I had thought about going to Marisa \'s house several times, but in reality Reimu has never disturbed the Kirishiri House until now. Rather than saying, Marisa dislikes. At the moment when I lighted the lantern of the room to seek a Kirishiri residence from tomorrow, Reimu memorized the illusion that the space had been distorted for a moment. Reimu lost me instantly, but after a while I picked up Yin Yang ball and Tamaki and left the shrine. The eye which looked slightly from the gap of the bangs was not the one of usual hilarious girl but the sharp light of the descendant of Hakurei was reflected. There is no rule in Gensokyo, but there is one thing called the rule of Hakurei. That means ... those who have destroyed the Hiroyuki boundary must be extinguished regardless of who they are.</p>\n<h2>-2-</h2>\n<p>A magical forest that exists in the hinterland of Gensokyo. Today \'s weakness was swirling more intensely and swirling, although a violent weakness always swirls here. The moment the outside world who has no magic power touches even a little bit this external atmosphere, it will evaporate without leaving any body. Marisa was at the center near the center of the forest ... but today it was far from Marisa, which is usual. After drinking sake "tap water", I threw the empty bottle in front of a purple poster in front of me, threw it out and handed to the next bottle. The eyes were empty and had lost half the light, but the spring that gushed from it had murderous intent not half the end. Actually, the other day, I just <a href="/tag/yakumo-family?order=ASC">burned Orange and Indigo</a> , which was good, but it has been turned down to purple. However, there is Marisa who does not like to lose it. At the moment when I thought that I would kill someday, a strange impact penetrates my body with a slight vibration. ... Apparently the opportunity seemed to come earlier than I thought. The impact now is almost definitely the effect of cracking in the Hakurei Great Boundary. And there are only two people in Gensokyo who can do such things. But one of them does not do such a thing ... when it comes to. Marisa who got drunk at last. It flew away to the outside world that there was no choice but to repent. ── And the two become the Kamikaze.</p>',frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"2004-08-30T00:17:57+09:00",strDate:"2004/8/29",title:"story"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/2004/08/30-ストーリー/",langKey:"en"}}}});
