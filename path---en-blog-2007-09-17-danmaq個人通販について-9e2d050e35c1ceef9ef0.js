From 2007/10, postage privatization will slightly change the fee structure (price increase), but we will continue to keep <em>postage · handling fee unchanged</em> for the time being (at least this year). However, we will change it to mailing in booklet parcel format instead of conventional non-standard-size sealed letter form. (The shape of the envelope changes slightly) Please note that.</p>\n<h2>I was letting my feathers be cluttered - this is also bad</h2>\n<p>I should have bought it when I first saw ... ... now it's sold out everywhere. I bet.</p>\n<h2>so</h2>\n<p>Sorry to have kept forever. I forgot log I finally found out. Please acknowledge that both clapping and lesbian are at that time. (Since the dream drama has already been developed, there is no plan to fix as long as serious flaws related to progress are not found)</p>\n<h2>(Beat) Do not you implement all the characters' bomcut in?</h2>\n<p>There is nothing you can not do, but in that case replay compatibility will be completely gone? It is somewhat funny like now, and the compatibility is getting thinner, or not.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) Why is the dream conquering drama so heavy? Please publish the source. I will fix it beautifully.</h2>\n<p>It is probably impossible for you. Assuming that we handed out the source tomorrow, I think that it will take probably more than a few months, even if you estimate how much it will be reduced to 5% lighter while maintaining the current production quality. Originally at the time of saying \"Please give me the source of a dream drama\" ... Hey?</p>\n<h2>(Beat) I told you to leave the barrage style, but what will you use next? ~</h2>\n<p>Well, one will use C ++ only, the other will use C ++ and Java in conjunction. The main development tools are Visual C ++ and Eclipse.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) better than the picture of the head family ... maybe like (ω -,)</h2>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) ~ When becoming a dream conquering theater Do not you become considerably heavier than Sealing Castle?</h2>\n<p>It is relatively heavy. However, I think that it became much lighter than the initial trial version of the dream drama. Also, since it is moving in the windscreen style, it will become heavier when it is about this size.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) ~ In addition, recently this site is also heavy!</h2>\n<p>To say it is better to reduce update effort, badly speaking of the author! (Hint: XML ← You will understand this)</p>\n<h2>(Beat) Is the remark that goes beyond the head family a fact?</h2>\n<p>Although I remember saying that I would like to make something unique in secondary creation with a vector that is different from the original, although it is the same genre as Vertical STG and Honke, though it is Toho. Is it supposed to be a tail finally saying? First of all, sprinkle with \"old age\".</p>\n<h2>(Beat) dot picture and music, because the road was nice, ask the scenario another person, why not?</h2>\n<p>A scenario (especially the ending part) is a thing to come up with thC (dream drama drama) project long before, it is the first time when you saw Eiya Nakasu staff roll for the first time on C66 's day, Ping! I thought of that. Does not it have to be embodied as it is? Just because its realization is SS or comic, or just STG or the difference.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) It is a pity that you will get soiled by Tales ~</h2>\n<p>Well, which part of the neighborhood did you say that it was dirty?</p>\n<h2>(Beat) It was delicious</h2>\n<p>It was a while ago</p>\n<h2>(Beat) test</h2>\n<p>Failure ... Access Denied.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) Do you think that you can express yourself Gensokyo more than Mr. ZUN when talking about real intention?</h2>\n<p>Yes. ...... I thought you would say that w If you really think so, I'm taking action one step further I'm acting seriously.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) By the way By the way, I'd like to play by all way through the surface ~</h2>\n<p>Because the flow of the story's story will not be connected, please play with the muddy in the stage practice etc.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) Is not it a mistake not to sell it if it is not Toho?</h2>\n<p>It is not. It is a lie if I assert Hakkiri affirmatively, but it is less than 1% of the total reason I decided to put out as the East.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) Do you think the dream conquest has succeeded?</h2>\n<p>Successful, it is a great success. Well, even though there were microscopic failures, there was a bit of chirp, but as I was watching it there was not it.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) trial version There are quite a few songs that I liked in the 1.x version ~</h2>\n<p>To be honest, it seems that there is not enough room to make a soundtrack, so please make it public on the Web</p>\n<h2>(Beat) The next work is going to be light, is not it?</h2>\n<p>It gets lighter. I do not have PC newly this time, so when it gets heavier than this I will be crazy even on my PC PC orz</p>\n<h2>(Beat) High quality, barrage beauty, arrange music, scenarios It is very inspirational.</h2>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) I want the soundtrack of the dream drama, Sue.</h2>\n<p>It might be tough on a schedule. Because it is contained in MP3 in the dream drama disk, please transfer it to the iPod.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) Cosplay ~?</h2>\n<p>Probably different w</p>\n<h2>(Beat) (more)</h2>\n<p>We can fly! Motto!

I am too clumsy / too tight even though I have received applause up to now, but they are about the same. I wonder if it is better to make Easy ~ Lunatic extreme a bit more.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) Well Oh, I do not accept it for those who love head home</h2>\n<p>Uchi was also similar for the first time in 2003 winter until it touched secondary creation in the East, so I do not know.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) Let's not do more, as far as the Tozai neighborhood collapses</h2>\n<p>I'm thinking a lot.</p>\n<h2>(Beat) Good luck!</h2>\n<p>Gangal</p>",frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"2007-09-17T00:00:00+09:00",strDate:"2007/9/16",title:"About danmaq personal mail order"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/2007/09/17-danmaq個人通販について/",langKey:"en"}}}});
