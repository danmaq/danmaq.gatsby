Suddenly I thought about making a picture-story show "Chi-chan\'s Kakageari" that was in a Japanese textbook. My brother got up at the place I made a scene of 1 or 2.</p>\n<p>"Stop picture-story shows and make a map"</p>\n<p>As my brother said, I abandoned the picture-story show and started making a map.</p>\n<p>"What\'s this?"</p>\n<p>As I got a map, my brother opened my desk and found a black seed in the drawer.</p>\n<p>"It\'s the seed of loofah, which I kept from autumn all the time"</p>\n<p>I answered, my brother said.</p>\n<p>"Let\'s sow the seed today"</p>\n<p>I shook my head next to you.</p>\n<p>"Plant this in spring"</p>\n<p>After that, I watched a little TV and realized that it was a good time and woke up my parents. Today, at the welfare hall of Moriyama Town, there is a theater called "Pinocchio."</p>\n<p>During the play, I suddenly ran around the audience seats, and I was surprised to see that theater had common sense of doing in the framework of the stage.</p>\n<p>When theater was over, I juiceed and waited for my parent car to come. It seems that I parked a lot in the distance, and it took quite a while for my car to come.</p>\n<p>After that, after lunch, in the afternoon I went to the municipal hall of the Moriyama Taeju area. There, puppetry play was doing.</p>\n<p>Even though the speaker was not talking, the voice came from the doll, so I was very surprised.</p>\n<p>When the puppet show ended, ballpoint pens and cakes were distributed to commemorate participation. It is my first ballpoint pen for me. It is fresh so far because I have used only aqueous imprint pen and pencil, coupe, crayon, and brush as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Speaking of freshness, I had my hair cut at the barber in the evening. It was awfully fresh.</p>',frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"1991-01-27T21:00:00+09:00",strDate:"1991/1/27",title:"diary"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/1991/01/27-diary/",langKey:"en"}}}});
