Sometimes I have come to sort of monsters and ghosts other than humans. However, the guests of this time could not hide a little surprise. It appeared in front of me was a little girl. The back may be as small or as pleasant as Marisa. That is normal. However, decayed feathers, fluffy white costumes ... And it seems that the inside of the room got warmer after the child came ... Well, that girl was unmistakably a fairy. Fairies are basically said to live if there is clean water and air. In general, thought that the fairy was a living thing without greediness, that is, a living thing not related to such a musty owner, what on earth is it for the old-door store? ...... Oops, it seems that he was too surprised to forget me. It is rude to the guests to show a little disrespectful face. "Is something you looking for, Mr. Fairy?" I chose to respond normally as a matter of time. "Um ... I came to tell you about spring" So I rounded my eyes again. She suddenly took off his clothes in front of me. I took off my hat ... I took off my jacket ... When she put on my underwear I returned to me and panicked it. After that, when I gave her a cup of tea and taught her the real meaning of Spring slowly, she blushed and left in a hurry and shyly. Perhaps I should not have stopped taking off as it is ... ... A little regret appears in me, but maybe well enough to get her underwear after persuasion. I\'m going to sleep soundly tonight.</p>',frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"2005-04-12T02:58:29+09:00",strDate:"2005/4/11",title:"Text"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/2005/04/12-本文-3/",langKey:"en"}}}});
