Because I got it I tried riding despite heavy rain. As I thought it was rumored that I started slowly. There is only a mission car, but there is still room for remodeling, and even if it says anything, the appearance is awesome. Is it the difference between 400 and 50 that I thought the connection of the clutch was bad compared to the SUFOA? It was quite a long time ago that I was riding Ben Rile, so I forgot the feeling. Well, I\'m planning to make a vehicle introduction page soon.
