I am attaching to the loop to make it like game music. It took quite a while to reproduce the unique brass sound of the shrine. (Moreover, it is not alike to say so much) It is a song that I made while shogunking with STG production, so it is a dark and intense arrangement w Although the melody is exactly the same as the original song, it is 360 degrees different atmosphere. It\'s already around a week. It is planned to be used for STG currently under <a href="/!/thA/">construction</a> , BGM of " <a href="/!/thA/">Tohru Hirafuku</a> ".
