In addition to being bad at rope jumping, on that day it is bad that the wind is strong, and because the rope is taken in the wind, I can not fly as I can. However, as if ignoring such tension in me, thinking that preparation gymnastics had ended, the order of examination came round to the group where I am.</p>\n<p>An examiner \'s teacher blew the whistle and flew all at once. If you notice it, the flute began ringing and it ended immediately.</p>\n<p>The result was "Special grade" at 102 times. I am relieved for a while.</p>\n<p>The next jump is over, the next is a time jump. In practice it is a time jump that did not keep even three minutes.</p>\n<p>"What if I can not do it, I want to take a special grade"</p>\n<p>My whistle \'s signs rang to my other place. Everyone knocks the rope all over the ground and jumps silently silently. I also flew to the slow pace.</p>\n<p>Maybe it was because I was slow, the first minute was okay. But my arm got sore soon, after three minutes my legs were already rattled and it seems to support me now. Even so, I continued flying, but I finally ended up with about ten seconds to the discrimination of a special class.</p>\n<p>The record was first class in a quarter and a half, it was.</p>\n<p>I have suddenly come to feel pain from my tired eyes. It is cold this season, even if you wear a coat, it will only be a rest day.</p>\n<p>Next is my biggest obstacle, double jump. My goal is ten times, but I have never succeeded in the examination so far. Furthermore, the wind gets even stronger, the feeling of limbs is gone, and I can not do it in practice even once.</p>\n<p>"If we fail this year, we will make everyone laugh"</p>\n<p>The whistle rang with my tension maximum. Three times normal leap jumping and putting on the run, we jump and punch.</p>\n<p>However, looking at the feet, the rope is entwined on the feet where the sense is gone by the cold.</p>\n<p>"I only have zero times since last year, I have to jump because I can do it even once"</p>\n<p>I will jump once again, but the rope stops at the feet.</p>\n<p>"You can do double jump, you can jump"</p>\n<p>While continuing believing, I finally flew. It is a double jump that I could fly for the first time in the test. I tried to continue, but it ended in three times.</p>\n<p>Although it was a bit frustrating that it ended in three times, I was very glad that there was worth the practice so far.</p>\n<p>There is no feeling of feet when supporting with cold, when you look at your feet the legs that come out of my short bread are all riddled with traces of rope. Did the tension get lost? Pain started to bleed afterwards.</p>\n<p>And the reverse quick jump which is difficult to turn the rope in the reverse direction, and the reverse test and the jump which could not be done ten times at the practice, all the exams are over.</p>\n<p>Although the result was a special event in the single event, the comprehensive level was very low, the seventh level. If the double jump was done a little more, the comprehensive grade might have gone up. Still, it is a fact that I was able to produce good results than practice and previous year. From now on I will practice a lot of jump rope and I hope to aim for a special class even in comprehensive class someday.</p>',frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"1991-02-16T21:00:00+09:00",strDate:"1991/2/16",title:"Tiring jump rope test"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/1991/02/16-diary/",langKey:"en"}}}});
