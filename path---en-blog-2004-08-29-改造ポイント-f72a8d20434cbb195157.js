So I bought the front and rear tires and came home. (Why did not you buy the brake shoes and tubes together?) Orz is the one you\'ve accustomed to once you\'ve done it. Just a little ... .... Oh. 16T front sprocket does not enter ... .... No, I caught on to getting caught, but I do not think about anything about the chain, AFAM. The chain brilliantly interfere with the clutch (? Probably) part. If I try to forcibly cover the case, I also hit the case ... I decided an object. As a result, only chain and rear sprockets were exchanged. Rear sprocket made of AFAM, which stands out in gold color, Hmm. But I guess the theft rate has also increased, this YB - 1. The maximum speed was extended by about 4 to 7 km / h by the meter reading. When the maximum speed is increased, the acceleration force is staggering, but there is not much change at the time of starting, rather the elongation worsens from around the third speed exceeding. It is not cost effective versus efficiency ... but, is this something like that? And the alumite is decreasing early. To those who are considering buying front sprockets. <em>It seems that the limit of YB-1 (especially the initial type) is 12 T, even if it works hard, the 13 T is limited (physically but not physically).</em> Damn, if the ability of the engine is said to be the limit, there was still room for remodeling. On top of that it is currently being skilful to scrape the interference part with a drill. <img src="https://danmaq.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/plug-300x225.jpg" alt="YB-1 plug"> High performance plug &#x26; high performance plug cord made by split fire. A large capacity capacitor is charged in the middle of the code and it seems to have the effect of raising the electric power necessary for explosion. Is it possible to say even with a power exciter integrated plug code? However, this capacitor went havoc and took a lot of trouble handling the cord. The position of the joint was also quite lost. There is no meaning of high performance code in the way ahead. In the end, it was completed by handling in clay wrapped around clutch wire by tie wrap. When I actually ran, I felt a certain acceleration feeling around low and medium speeds, not before installation. I regret not having had the fastest up. <img src="https://danmaq.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/chamber-300x225.jpg" alt="YB-1 chamber"> A mysterious chamber.  Both manufacturer and model number are unknown.  It seems to be a racer type chamber of kijima. (THX2 ぼ \'s like) Purchased at an example bike shop at 5,000 yen. Anyway it seems to be for YB - 1. Only JMCA certification, there is conscientious sound more than straight pipe. However, it seemed like a turnip before, it became a sound that seemed to skip like anything like NS-1. However, running does not change so much, whether or not the feeling torque has increased. I guess it is necessary to also set intake system. Also, the black chamber does not like something normal. (Note: the normal chamber of YB - 1 is not black, it is the same chrome plating as the rear fender etc ...) But ... but it sounds okay so let\'s forgive. By the way, since this chamber will inevitably interfere with the center stand, it is necessary to remove the center stand for the initial type YB - 1. I also cried out crying. ...... That center stand, it\'s amazingly convenient for tire change ... .... Talks at a later date. At that time the speedometer was still out of order and the speed was unknown, but when I added the speedometer later, I recorded 68 km / h on the flat. Actually, was it rising fairly fast?  Oh, but the possibility that the previous owner changed the sprocket can not be denied.  When counting the number of sprockets when it was converted F11R39 ...... It was genuine. I wonder whether the rotation speed increased by exchanging the chamber indeed. Further talks at a later date. There was a crack in place to fix with the nut and it became useless. Basically, if you break the 2st chamber basically it will not only make the sounds huge, but obviously both the maximum speed and power will sharply decrease (even though it was 65 km / h, it was still out) After all it returned to normal. ...... But it seems that the limiter effect is obviously applied at this normal, highest speed (even with sprocket F11R35) at 62 km / h on the flat and 65 km / h on the downhill. It is often said that YB - 1 is wearing a limiter with a muffler instead of CDI, but it does not mean that you can feel the limiter so far. <img src="https://danmaq.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/meter-300x225.jpg" alt="YB-1 meter"> Because the genuine speedometer was broken and did not work (I\'ve heard that the original speedometer of YB - 1 is broken soon), I bought a new speedometer. I was lost intensely whether it was 140 km / h inscription or 220 km / h notation, but I thought that 140 km / h would not go even if I remodeled, I decided to be 140 km / h. However, since this meter does not have an indicator, purchase a separate indicator kit. I felt it was enough if I had such a LED and stay w but this indicator, additionally, the light of the LED can not be seen unless it is not dark and night. Will it make it a high luminance type w? After that, if it is only a speedometer, it seems that the electric balance tachometer will be installed even if it is not well balanced in appearance. But it\'s almost time for the battery to last. At a later date, I also attached an electric tachometer, but the car body itself became obsolete and passed away the following month. <img src="https://danmaq.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/lamp-300x225.jpg" alt="YB-1 fog lamp"> Although I am remodeling details in detail, it is pretty easy to enter from a form (although it can not be done gorgeously because I can change my eyes if I change my details and runs, but I can not do it w w w w f I tried w It is quite a stylish guy illuminating with considerable illuminance for the size.It is also very beautiful with a cold gradation of color.The suspension and fender are dirty but properly care W I am going to install a side bag again, so I have to change places again.</p>',frontmatter:{cover:null,date:"2004-08-29T00:00:01+09:00",strDate:"2004/8/28",title:"Modification point"}}},pathContext:{path:"/en/blog/2004/08/29-改造ポイント/",langKey:"en"}}}});
