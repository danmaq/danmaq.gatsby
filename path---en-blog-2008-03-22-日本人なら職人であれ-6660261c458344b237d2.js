Especially in the workplace it is clearly visible. Actually doing programmers and doing SEs at work but I often see many programs that are really bad. Even a little even if it understands the relationship between hardware and software, the mechanism of action, memory handling etc. If it understands, it is only a strange and mysterious source code that never combines. And the creator is behaving like this because it is too slow to work practically .... I think the author of Bible "C Programming Diagnostic Office" at home is evaluating too much better than the actual workplace. (No, this book was well before that, so it may have been decent at the time) There is a theory that the programming language is bad. Recent languages ​​are too soft for people and tend to be hard on hardware. Even if you look at the code, it is difficult to understand how to translate into machine language. In the future, there will also be compilation languages ​​(which Mr. Yuneune et al. Also said) to translate into machine language precisely just by saying "It\'s enough for this!", On the other hand, It will be even more like people mistaking the brakes. I think that a manual car is absolutely necessary also for the programming language. Including the meaning that it also needs a language that will bring out the marginal performance of hardware. There is also a theory that programmers are getting rotten. Certainly there are lots of occupation programmers in the workplace where I was involved, and on the contrary the craftsman seems to be an endangered species. ↓ "I do not understand it because I have not learned at a vocational school or in-house training" ↓ "I do not have time to study without being able to release the task I am doing now" ↓ "I want to clearly divide the time of work and individuals ..." The royal road of such a dummy programmer, a senior who goes by hand to make a triple triple combo lies. I would like to preach the teachings of an autonomous ancient Roman thinker, Gugurecas (Gugurecus / birth and death year). When it becomes awful, someone who only manipulates the junior programmer with his / her chin, realizes the development SE with its ability to create a table with Excel. But I promise that they are earlier in pay raise and salary is higher. There is no longer any international competitiveness in the current Japanese software industry, and future programmers will be ridiculed as being taken over by the Asian region, but one of the causes is that the Japanese "craftsmanship" is diminished It must not be thought that it is not. (Of course, there should be other causes, but since it is not likely to be written first, I will hand it over to another opportunity.) In a way it feels like the same guard neighborhood as the last fortress. For software outside himself, is "craftsmanship oriented" a thing that is no longer outdated nonsense? Is there a guy trying to make an unknown data compression technique that exceeds LHA · GCA? Will I be inspired to pursue after <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona">Mona</a> , who is actually making me? Is there no one who wants to become <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby">Mr. Matsumoto</a> the second one? For the most part, "amazing" software algorithms come from "amazing" programmers, this is almost certain. And it is "craftsmanship oriented" common to most authors. This is exactly what raises the quality of the Japanese program, increases the de facto standard from Japan, and ultimately will be the first step to have international competitiveness. For the time being, I am conscious of such a thing, working on work, and working on doujinshi. It is not such a thing just because it did not adapt to the upstream process aside separately! (Incidentally, if you are too craftsmen oriented too this time it will be getting caught up in delivery etc etc, so it will be troubled by another meaning <strong>_ _</strong> <strong>_ _</strong> 0 There are things, but on another occasion. And if you write too much about it, you will be told that "Oh, you can not make anything else", \'A `(I\'m sorry by a bad programmer that does not make a distinction between pointers and <a href="/image/mixi/poring.jpg">polins</a> )</p>\n<h2>(Beat) Shooting has done Aaaaaaaaaaaaa! ! ! ! ! 11</h2>\n<p>Sorry I guess I\'m gonna make RPG ahead</p>\n<h2>(Beat) Why is not it on wiki?</h2>\n<p>Because it is a secondary creation.
